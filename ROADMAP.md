# Roadmap of Xane

> Xane is an order book decentralized exchange on Mina Protocol.

> **Update:** All of the goals are implemented. However a long fixing session is required to make the UI functioning due to problems with Mina nodes.

## Goals For December, 2023.

- Use [`Astro.js`](https://astro.build/) & [`Solid.js`](https://www.solidjs.com/) instead of [`Svelte`](https://svelte.dev/) for the UI.
- Make `Exchange` smart contract work as expected.
- Implement storage of contract addresses of the tokens created by users on the backend.
- Implement storage of the state of `Exchange` smart contract on the backend.
- Make `Exchange` smart contract require signature of the backend to update on-chain state.
- Implement token creation.
- Implement token management.
- Implement pair creation.
- Implement order placing & execution.
- Make the UI display order-book.

> Xane is being developed by [Berzan](https://github.com/BerzanXyz).
